## Data Science Project Regression Modeling : California Housing Price Prediction Overview
..* Build a machine learning regression model to estimate and predict housing price located in california region.
..* Engineered some feaures to better specify how many rooms, bedrooms per rooms, bedrooms per household and population per household.
--* Exploratory data with seaborn and matplotlib help giving better understanding of which specific area having the heighest or lowest house price and which are the most densely populated.
--* One hot encoding and standard scaler are used to pre process dataaset before implemented it to machine learning model.
--* Linear regression, Support Vector regression and Tree based and Gradient boosting regressor model are used alongside gridsearch cv to find and optimize the best best model.

### Code and Resource Used
__* Packages : pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit learn

### Exploratory Data Analysis
